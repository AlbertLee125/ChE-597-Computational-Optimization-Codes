        "question": "How do you troubleshoot the infeasibility of the model using Gurobi's IIS feature, and what does the analysis reveal?",
        "answer": "The IIS feature of Gurobi is used to identify the minimal set of conflicting constraints or bounds that cause the model's infeasibility. In this case, the IIS analysis pinpointed two critical constraints that are unsatisfiable under the current model configuration. These constraints likely involve task scheduling or sequencing that contradict each other or are too restrictive to allow any feasible solution. Adjusting these constraints or the underlying assumptions about task durations and dependencies might be necessary to resolve the infeasibility. The analysis is crucial for understanding exactly which parts of the model need revision to achieve feasibility.",

        "answer":"Modifying the precedence constraints between tasks B2 and B3 from a strict finish-to-start requirement to a less restrictive start-anytime-after-start condition removed the infeasibility in the model. Initially, Task B3 was required to start only after Task B2 had completed, which created a scheduling conflict under certain tight constraints or resource limitations. By allowing Task B3 to start anytime after Task B2 begins, the model gained flexibility in scheduling, allowing overlapping of tasks that share resources or operate concurrently. This adjustment reduced the makespan to 10.0 and provided a feasible solution where all tasks were scheduled optimally without violating any operational constraints.",
