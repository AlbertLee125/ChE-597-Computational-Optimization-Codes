        "question": "How do you troubleshoot the infeasibility of the model using Gurobi's IIS feature, and what does the analysis reveal?",
        "answer": "The IIS analysis performed using Gurobi's IIS feature highlights the specific constraints and bounds contributing to the model's infeasibility. By setting the IISMethod parameter to 1, Gurobi identifies the smallest subset of the model where no feasible solution exists even if all other constraints are removed. In this case, the analysis revealed 5 constraints and 2 bounds that are irreducibly inconsistent. These constraints likely involve overly restrictive relationships between start times and durations of certain tasks, dictating conditions that are logically or physically impossible to satisfy given the model's parameters and the task scheduling requirements. Addressing these inconsistencies might involve relaxing or redefining certain constraints or revising the task dependencies and scheduling logic to ensure that all specified conditions can be realistically met.",

        "question": "How adding slack variables to the model can help address infeasibility issues?",
        "answer":"Slack variables allow scheduling models to adjust the rigidity of timing constraints between tasks, providing necessary flexibility. In the context of job scheduling, introducing slack variables to downtime constraints enables tasks to start slightly later than originally planned without violating the schedule. This adjustment can resolve conflicts between consecutive tasks that need downtime, helping the model find feasible solutions even when initial constraints appear too strict. By softening these constraints, slack variables help accommodate unforeseen variations in task durations or start times, enhancing the model's ability to handle real-world complexities and uncertainties.",
