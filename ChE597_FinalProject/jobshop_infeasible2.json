        "question": "How do you troubleshoot the infeasibility of the model using Gurobi's IIS feature, and what does the analysis reveal?",
        "answer": "The IIS analysis, performed using Gurobi, identified three constraints and two bounds as the primary causes of infeasibility in the job shop scheduling model. These constraints and bounds create conflicting requirements that cannot be satisfied simultaneously under the current model configuration. Specifically, the constraints involve relationships between several tasks that are mathematically impossible to satisfy given the set bounds on task start times. To address the infeasibility, it is recommended to reevaluate and potentially relax these constraints or revise the task dependency structure to remove any cyclical dependencies.",

        "question": "How does removing the dependency between Task A and Task C affect the scheduling model's feasibility and solution?",
        "answer":"Removing the cyclic dependencies between Task A ('A1') and Task C ('C2') markedly improved the model's feasibility, allowing for an optimal solution with a makespan of 8.0 units. This adjustment resolved previous scheduling conflicts, enabling all tasks to be efficiently sequenced without delay. Specifically, Task A1 and B2 were scheduled to start at time 0.0, demonstrating immediate task initiation. The removal of these dependencies facilitated a coherent and streamlined scheduling sequence, leading to an effective alignment of tasks with no idle times. This outcome highlights the critical importance of accurate dependency structuring in optimization models to prevent unsolvable scheduling conflicts and achieve optimal resource utilization.",
