# Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP)

# Three jobs (A,B,C) must be executed sequentially in three steps, but not all jobs require all the stages. 
# The objective is to obtain the sequence of tasks which minimizes the completion time. 
# Once a job has started it cannot be interrupted. 
# The objective is to obtain the sequence of task, which minimizes the completion time.
# The original model is a linear Generalized Disjunctive Programming (GDP) model and the given code is reformulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model.

Style Guide:

- Use short and descriptive names for variables, parameters, and constraints.
- Use comments to describe the purpose of the model, sets, parameters, variables, and constraints.
- Always use the doc attribute to provide a short description of the model, sets, parameters, variables, and constraints.
- Always indicate Sets with Capitalized names and variables with lowercase names.
- Always use `import pyomo.environ as pyo` to import Pyomo.
- Use different names for each set, constraint, variable, and parameter.
- Always make the parameters Mutable, i.e. set `mutable=True`.
- Always name the model as `model`.
