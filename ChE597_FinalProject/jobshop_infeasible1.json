        "question": "How do you troubleshoot the infeasibility of the model using Gurobi's IIS feature, and what does the analysis reveal?",
        "answer": "The IIS analysis, performed using Gurobi, identified a critical subset of 6 constraints and 3 variable bounds that are responsible for the model's infeasibility. The constraints in question appear to involve relationships between variables x1, x2, x3, x6, and x7, with several conditions stipulating that certain differences between these variables must adhere to specific bounds. These constraints, combined with unrestricted bounds on variables x3 and x7, contribute to an unsolvable conflict under the current model configuration. To address these issues, adjusting the bounds on x1, x3, and x7, or revising the coefficients and right-hand side values of the constraints may be necessary. This detailed understanding enables targeted modifications to the model to achieve feasibility.",

        "question": "How does iteratively increasing the makespan upper bound lead to a feasible solution in the job shop scheduling model?",
        "answer":"The process of incrementally increasing the makespan upper bound from a tightly constrained initial value was aimed at finding the minimum feasible makespan that accommodates all scheduled tasks without violation. Initially, the model was set with an infeasible upper bound (10 units less than the total duration of all tasks), causing infeasibility. By progressively increasing this bound in increments of 5 units and reattempting to solve the model, a feasible scheduling configuration was eventually found. The model became feasible with a makespan of 10 units, where all tasks could be scheduled without overlapping constraints, achieving optimal scheduling under adjusted conditions.",
