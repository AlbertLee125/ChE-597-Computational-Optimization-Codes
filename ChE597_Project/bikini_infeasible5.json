        "question": "Troubleshoot the infeasibility",
        "answer": "The infeasibility in the model was primarily due to the constraints that production in any quarter must not exceed the set capacities which were too low compared to the demands. The demand got higher and the production getting lower caused the infeasibility. Moreover, constraints in earlier quarters can have a domino effect on later quarters. If one quarter's demands aren't met adequately (due to capacity or inventory issues), it can make subsequent quarters infeasible under current configurations",

        "question": "How does introducing slack variables with bounded values affect the feasibility and outcome of the bikini manufacturing problem model?",
        "answer": "Introducing slack variables with bounded values helps maintain feasibility by providing a flexible buffer to manage demand overflows, which prevents the model from becoming infeasible under variable demand conditions. This adjustment, however, increases the total holding costs as seen with a cost of $63,000 in this scenario, reflecting the economic trade-off for higher operational flexibility. Slack was essential in managing excess demands, especially in quarters where demand outstripped production capacity.",
