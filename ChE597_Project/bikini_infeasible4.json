        "question": "Suppose I have more capacity for the production in the fourth quarter. Will my model become feasible if I can increase the capacity of production? Use the slack variables.",
        "answer": "Yes, the model becomes feasible when slack variables are used to handle excess demand. The solution becomes feasible with a total holding cost of $50,000, incorporating the penalties for using slack variables. Key observations include the use of substantial slack in the first and fourth quarters (1600 and 1150 dozens respectively) to meet the excess demand. This adjustment ensures all demands are met despite the initial production constraints, illustrating the effectiveness of incorporating slack variables into the model to enhance flexibility and maintain feasibility",
