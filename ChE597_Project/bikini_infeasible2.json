        "answer": "The model infeasibility is primarily due to the total demand across all quarters exceeding the set production capacities. Key steps to resolve this include verifying the accuracy of demand forecasts, considering increases to production capacities where possible, and potentially introducing slack variables to the model to provide additional flexibility. Specifically, adjusting the capacity constraint in Q2 (x16: x7 <= 600) could be critical as it is significantly lower than in other quarters.",

        "question": "Suppose I have some capacity for production at the plant. Will my model become feasible if I can make some small changes to the demand? Try adding the slack variables with bounded values to see how the outcome affects the feasibility and outcome of the bikini manufacturing problem.",
        "answer": "The use of bounded slack variables has highlighted areas where production capacity adjustments could significantly enhance model feasibility and economic efficiency. Specifically, increasing production capacities in Q1 and Q4 where negative slacks were observed could help meet excess demand, potentially improving customer satisfaction and sales. Conversely, reducing unnecessary capacity in Q2, as indicated by positive slack, could decrease operational costs. These adjustments should be carefully analyzed for economic viability and aligned with strategic business objectives to ensure overall profitability.",
