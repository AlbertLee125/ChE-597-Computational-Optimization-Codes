        "answer": "The IIS analysis identified 9 constraints that are contributing to the model's infeasibility. This subset of constraints, when considered in isolation, are still infeasible, indicating that adjustments within this subset are necessary to resolve the issues. Typically, this involves relaxing certain constraints or increasing capacity or supply limits to accommodate the demand requirements specified. The identified constraints primarily involve production capacity and demand satisfaction equations, which suggest that the current setup does not allow for meeting the demand with the available production capacity.",

        "question": "How does introducing slack variables with bounded values affect the feasibility and outcome of the bikini manufacturing problem model?",
        "answer": "The slack variables allowed the model to handle discrepancies between production capabilities and demand more flexibly. For instance, significant positive slack in Quarter 1 and Quarter 4 suggests overestimations of demand or preemptive overproduction, potentially to buffer against uncertainties. Conversely, negative slack in Quarter 3 indicates where demand slightly exceeded supply, necessitating precise adjustments in future planning cycles. This flexibility helped achieve feasibility but also highlighted areas in demand forecasting and production planning that could be optimized for cost efficiency.",
